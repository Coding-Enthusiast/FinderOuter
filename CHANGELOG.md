[Full Changelog](https://github.com/Coding-Enthusiast/FinderOuter/compare/v0.9.0.0...v0.10.0.0)  
**BigInteger Be Gone!**  

This release introduced a new code for Elliptic Curve Cryptography that also solves issue #9.  
Effectively this brings a ton of optimization to almost all options, mainly the mnemonic recovery and
Base16 rcovery. But also any option that required an `ICompareService` that used ECC.  
By getting rid of the old ECC code and `BigInteger` this also solves the pressure on garbage collector
and lets FinderOuter utilize the entire CPU power during parallelism.  
Speed gain in this release is usually around 200% compared to previous releases.  
Good news is that this is the initial step for more optimization! For example the current ECC implementation
uses radix 2^26 and contstant time operations, changing to radix 2^52 and using variable time operations, etc
will improve the speed more.  

Some additional changes:
* Path recovery can now accept any extended keys (xprv, ypub, zprv, ?pub, ...)
* It is now possible to recover a WIF missing up to 11 characters from the end
* Reports generated by MissingEncoding option are improved
* Various code improvements and tests
* From this version we are also releasing binaries for 3 operating systems (Linux, Windows and MacOs all x64)

* Some small improvements in address validation and error message

### Release 0.8.0 (2021-03-20)

* Some user interface improvements
* **New recovery option**: find BIP-32 derivation path
* **New recovery option**: recover Armory backup phrases missing some characters
* Main window size has a limit so it can no longer be shrinked to nearly nothing

### Release 0.7.0 (2021-02-02)

### Release 0.5.0 (2020-09-17)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/Coding-Enthusiast/FinderOuter/compare/v0.4.1.0...v0.5.0.0)  
**The Parallelization Update**  
This is the parallelism update with tons of optimization from a small 10% speed gain to more than 1800% in some cases.  
- Most of these optimizations are in Base58 recovery option.  
  - Compressed and uncompressed private key recovery uses all available CPU cores for maximum speed and at 100% capacity.
  - Two special cases were added to recover private keys that are missing characters from their end (up to 9 missing for uncompressed and 11 for compressed is the default for now and can be recovered in less than a minute).  
  - Recovery of Base58 addresses and BIP-38 encrypted keys are also optimized the same way.
- Mini private key recovery
  - It uses all available CPU cores
  - It suffers from the known issue #9
  - The extra input has more options like other recovery options to enter different types of addresses or a public key.
- Mnemonic recovery
  - New wordlist added (Czech)
  - There is a simple checkbox now to set the key index itself to be hardened
  - It suffers from the known issue #9 whenever there is EC multiplication involved (private key to public key), otherwise if there weren't any the code will run at maximum efficiency using all cores at 100% (see 5th example in mnemonic recovery)

Other most notable changes:
- Now there is a progress bar at the bottom that will be used when recovering in parallel to show the progress so far. Other times when using single core the recovery process never takes up longer than a minute (usually less than 10 seconds) so progress bar is disabled.  
- Addition of more examples for each recovery option.  
- Various code improvements and bug fixes.

### Release 0.4.1 (2020-07-23)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/Coding-Enthusiast/FinderOuter/compare/v0.4.0.0...v0.4.1.0)
* This minor release introduces the Example button in order to simplify the recovery process even more, 
it could be helpful to show how some boxes should be filled in more complex cases such as BIP-32 paths.
